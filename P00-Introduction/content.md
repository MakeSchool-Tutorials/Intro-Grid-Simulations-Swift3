title: "Grid Simulations: Introduction"
slug: introduction
---

Earlier you learned about one and two dimensional arrays, and in the process made Conway's Game of Life using Swift Playgrounds. In this tutorial, you'll bring the same code you wrote there, and bring it to Xcode as an iOS project. From there, you'll be able to run the Game of Life in the iOS Simulator, or your own iPhone! Next, you'll modify your existing Game of Life logic to create a new Grid Simulation of your very own, that emulates the spread of forest fires.

> Xcode 8 and Swift 3 was released on September 13th, 2016. Please make sure to update as soon as possible. [The first lesson](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/tutorial/getting-started-with-xcode-playgrounds-0afee09b-0bdb-47bd-8551-e179266b6b65/get-started-with-xcode-74d7476e-22f1-403c-99ab-b767f1a7b71e) has been updated with instructions for checking your version and updating if necessary.

**These are the instructions for Xcode 8. If you have Xcode 7 and cannot update, please go back to the dashboard and select the Xcode 7 version.**

## Prerequisites

As stated before, you need to have completed the Arrays and Loops Playground. Open it up so that you can copy your code over easily.

If you want to run this on your iPhone, you'll need to have your iOS developer account set up.

You'll also need our starter Xcode project for Grid Simulations, available on  [here](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Intro-Grid-Simulations-Swift-Starter/archive/swift3.zip). Go download the project, unzip the folder and open the enclosed file named `Grid-Simulations.xcodeproj`. You're ready to begin!
